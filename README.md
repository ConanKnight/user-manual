`Manual.adoc` is the final document intended for users to read and learn from.

`Goals.adoc` is a document for the manual writers, to define a coherent idea of what the Manual should be like.

`Overview.adoc` is a broad perspective on the whole Manual structure and contents - it's there to help the writers understand how the manual is structured and how the information flows within it.
