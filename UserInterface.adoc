=== User interface conventions

There are a few standard types of controls (provide screenshot for each)

* Buttons
* Sliders
* Knobs
* Number fields
* anything else?

The knobs and sliders can be reset to their default position with a double-click or a middle-mouse-click.

=== Using the Keyboard

Zyn-Fusion lets you use the keyboard in two ways:

* playing notes with the alpha-numeric keyboard
* accessing special functions with modifier keys

For example you can play a C-4 note by pressing the Q key

Holding down Ctrl will temporarily activate Learn mode - any control touched will be assigned to a macro.
Holding down Shift will temporarily activate Fine mode - this will greatly increate the input resolution allowing for more precise manipulation.



=== Panels
When you run Zyn-Fusion you'll be presented with this window:

As you can see it is divided into multiple panels.

TODO:: list the panels and briefly explain their function

* top panel
* bottom panel
* main panel
* side bar

TODO:: Then we'll split up each into parts and describe what each part does in detail, covering every button and field. When a button opens Ia dialog of another window. For example clicking on the the logo opens up settings - we can branch out and cover that in a different section if it's approperiate. For example a chapter about Zyn preferences and simply say "here are user preferences - more on that in chapter X"

==== Top Panel

* Logo
* File menu
* Audio capture controls
* MIDI and Learn buttons

=== Bottom Panel

* Virtual keyboard (also usable with QWERTY keaboard - that;s important!)

=== Main Panel

Here's where the most of the action happens.
When you start Zyn-Fusion it'll begin by showing you the Browser.
Use the Side Bar to slelect what should be displayed here.

There's not much to say about this region of the interface, becasue it's looks and functions will vary wildly based on the context, which leads us to talking about the...

=== Side Panel

The side panel is used to navigate between different parts of the user interface.
Whatever you'll activate here will be opened in the Main Panel.
