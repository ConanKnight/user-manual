=== ADDsynth

AdSynth, a primarily _additive synthesis_ engine, is one of the three major synthesis engines available in Zyn-Fusion. The basic concept of this engine is the summation of a collection of voices, each of which consist of oscillators.

.Additive Synthesis
NOTE: Additive synthesis creates sound by combining multiple sin waves of varying phases and amplitudes; typically starting with a single sin wave (carrier) and modulating it with other sin waves (modulators).

==== Global settings
These settings will be applied to all voices.

==== Voice settings
The Voice settings allow you to modify setting _per voice_. These options include all of the `Global Settings` above as well as new ones such as the modulator, oscillator, and unison features.

.Helpful Tip
NOTE: The output of any single voice will always include a combination of individual Voice settings being applied on top of Global settings. Global settings will be applied to an active voices _before_ any individual voice settings are applied.
