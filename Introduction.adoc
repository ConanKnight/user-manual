=== What is Zyn-Fusion?

Zyn-Fusion is a powerful, modern, multiplatform, open-source software sound synthesizer. Zyn-Fusion is a successor to ZynAddSubFX, bringing in a new graphical user interface, and improved backend. It can work as a standalone application, or as a VST, LV2 or DSSI plugin.

TODO:: anything else?

=== Main features

TODO:: Maybe it's not a good idea to repeat the feature list from the main page? Or maybe it's a good idea to try to update that instead

* Zyn-Fusion is actually three synthesizers in one box - they can play together
* multitimbral: can play multiple patches at once using different MIDI channels, or simply layer then together for complex sounds
* we can layers sounds like no one else (parts, kits, addsynth voices, multiple engines)
* Built in effects
* 16 macro slots for automation or live control - everything can be automated (unlike the old ZynAddSubFX interface)
