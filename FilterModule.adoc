==== Filter Classes

Zyn-Fusion features three classes of filters.

State variable filters:: Limited filter types, but good under heavy modulation
Analog filters:: Standard Biquad formulations for a variety of shapes
Formant filters:: Good for modeling speech spectral shapes. Composed by many
sub-filters.

===== Analog Filters

// fundamental, could you fill this in? - unfa

LP1:: One pole low pass
HP1:: One pole high pass
LP2:: Two pole low pass
HP2:: Two pole high pass
BP::  Bandpass
Notch:: Notch
Peak:: Peak
L.Shelf:: low shelf
H.Shelf:: high shelf

Low::  Two pole low pass
High:: Two pole high pass
Band:: Bandpass
Notch:: Notch

===== Formant Filter

The formant filter is a separate class on it's own.
It's a complex filter that will let you define presets of peak filters,
arrange them in a sequence and then smoothly interpolate between them.
This way you can apply very complex and animated filtering to shape the
harmonic profile of your sounds and make it evolve over time.
More on that later in this chapter.
