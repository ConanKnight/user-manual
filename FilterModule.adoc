Zyn-Fusion features three classes of filters.

===== Analog Filters

===== State Variable Filters

===== Formant Filter

The formant filter is a separate class on it's own. It's a complex filter that will let you define presets of peak filters, arrange them in a sequence and then smoothly interpolate between them. This way you can apply very complex and animated filtering to shape the harmonic profile of your sounds and make it evolve over time. More on that later in this chapter.
